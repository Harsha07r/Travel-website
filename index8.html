                Kashmir is a state which is equally rich in cultural and natural wonders along with the myriad of history and political past that this state is home to. This state provides unique experiences to its tourists in the form of spicy native food along with a variety of teas, long walks or a jagged trekking experience on the many mountains in the region, marvelling at the cozy houseboats on the lakes of Srinagar and visiting the many pilgrimage sites, temples and religious and spiritual centres that are present throughout the state.</p>
